## Introduction
*Cluster analysis aims at partitioning the input data into groups of closely related instances that belong to the same cluster and are more
similar to each other than to instances that belong to other clusters.

## K-means Clustering
*The K-means clustering algorithm represents each cluster by its correspoinding cluster centroid. The algorithm partitions the input datainto k disjoint clusters by iteratively applying the following steps :-
* Form K clusters by assigning each instance to its nearest centroid
* Recompute the centroid of each cluster.
