Contributions are most welcome, whether you’ve fixed a bug or introduced a new feature in the notebook. I welcome pull requests! (If you’d like to make a larger change and check with me first, you can do so via (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-gitonga-b29730163/).

## Introduction
* Cluster analysis aims at partitioning the input data into groups of closely related instances that belong to the same cluster and are more
similar to each other than to instances that belong to other clusters.

## K-means Clustering
The K-means clustering algorithm represents each cluster by its correspoinding cluster centroid. The algorithm partitions the input datainto k disjoint clusters by iteratively applying the following steps :-
* Form K clusters by assigning each instance to its nearest centroid
* Recompute the centroid of each cluster.

## How to run this project from GitHub

### Run it in your local Python environment
* You can download the notebook from my GitHub repository and run it in your local Python environment using either browser interface to Jupyter/JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code.
* Since I uploaded the notebook in a pdf file format, you should first convert it into a jupyter notebook to make it executable
```sh
.ipynb notebook
```
