## Contribute Code
Contributions are most welcome, whether you’ve fixed a bug or introduced a new feature in the notebook. I welcome pull requests! (If you’d like to make a larger change and check with me first, you can do so via (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-gitonga-b29730163/).

## Introduction
* Cluster analysis aims at partitioning the input data into groups of closely related instances that belong to the same cluster and are more
similar to each other than to instances that belong to other clusters.

## K-means Clustering
The K-means clustering algorithm represents each cluster by its correspoinding cluster centroid. The algorithm partitions the input datainto k disjoint clusters by iteratively applying the following steps :-
* Form K clusters by assigning each instance to its nearest centroid
* Recompute the centroid of each cluster.

## How to run this project from GitHub
### Method 1 : Using Binder
* Since I uploaded the notebook in a pdf file type, you should first convert it in a ```sh
.ipynb
```
* MyBinder.org is a great project that allows you to create virtualized Jupyter Notebook environment from any GitHub repository. 
* You just need to enter the URL, and Binder will create a container for you, and start Jupyter environment. 
* Many repositories with Jupyter Notebooks include Launch Binder button to open the repository in Binder automatically.

* Binder will try to setup an environment best suited for your needs.

### Method 2 : Using GitHub Codespaces
* GitHub Codespaces is a great feature of GitHub that allows you to open any repository in a virtualized environment in the cloud, and access it through either online VS Code editor in your browser, or through local VS Code installation. 
* Currently, you may sign up for beta access to Codespaces, which will include some free compute to run your notebooks on.

### Method 3 : Run it in your local Python environment
* You can download the notebook from my GitHub repository and run it in your local Python environment using either browser interface to Jupyter/JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code.
